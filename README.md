## Heading ##
Dynamic data visualation for agriculture production by state

## Sub-Heading ##
Providing a user friendly experience to access agricultural data provided by the Department of Agriculture. 

## Summary ##
We created an easy way for users to be able to view data provided by the USDA about agriculture production. Instead of requiring the user to filter through charts or plain text data to access this information as it is provided by the USDA, we created a smooth and intuitive user interface that gives the user that same data in clean and dynamic graphs.

## Problem ##

The problem is that there was no simple platform that visualizes data provided by the USDA in a clean, simple, user friendly, and intuitive way. This app is an open-sourced effort to provide a service that will not only address this issue, but can be expanded and further built open by others to fit their own needs as well.

## Solution ##

Through the use of open-source code to create maps and graphs, and access to the public API's provided by the USDA, we are able to grab all of this information and simply make it easy to read.  

## How to Get Started ##

To get started using this service, just click on the state you wish to view information. Below the map will appear a set of choices for each particular type of data that is available to be displayed for that state. Upon selecting a choice, a graph with the requested information will then be displayed to the user. To view another type of commodity just click on the same state again, or click another state to view that state's statistics.
